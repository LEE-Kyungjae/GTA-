# GTA5 Suspend Tool

The **GTA5 Suspend Tool** is a simple utility designed to help resolve the infinite loading issue in **Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5)**. This tool works by suspending and resuming the `gta5.exe` process, a method similar to the commonly known "LAN cable unplugging trick" used by players to bypass long loading screens in the game.

## Features
- **Process Suspension**: Automatically detects the `gta5.exe` process, suspends it momentarily, and resumes it to help bypass loading issues.
- **No Network Interference**: Unlike other methods, this program doesn't interfere with your network connection, making it easier and safer to use.
- **Simple UI**: Provides a straightforward interface to suspend and resume the process with minimal user interaction.

## How It Works
1. **Launch GTA5** and wait until you encounter a long or infinite loading screen.
2. **Run the GTA5 Suspend Tool**.
3. The tool will:
   - Find the `gta5.exe` process.
   - Suspend the process for a short period.
   - Resume the process, allowing the game to load properly.
4. You should be able to bypass the infinite loading screen and continue playing.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or higher.
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Version 8 or above must be installed on your system to run this Java-based program.
- **GTA5**: The game must be running for the tool to function properly.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release of the **GTA5 Suspend Tool** from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LEE-Kyungjae/GTA5-Suspender).
2. Ensure that you have Java installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
3. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file and run the `GTA무한로딩해제.exe` executable file.

## Usage Instructions
1. Launch **GTA5** and wait for the infinite loading screen.
2. Open **GTA무한로딩해제.exe**.
3. The program will automatically suspend and resume the game process to bypass the loading screen.
4. Once the game loads, you can continue playing as usual.

## Troubleshooting
- **The program isn't finding the `gta5.exe` process**: Ensure that GTA5 is running and that no other program is interfering with the process detection.
- **The loading screen issue persists**: Try running the tool multiple times if the loading issue continues. The effectiveness may vary depending on system performance and game updates.
